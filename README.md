This is an attempt to recreate MyAnimeList(https://myanimelist.net/) in Android Studio using Jikan(https://docs.api.jikan.moe/).

This project relies on several dependiencies :

Android Jetpack's Navigation(https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) and Lifecycle(https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle).

Firebase(https://firebase.google.com/) to store user data.

Retrofit(https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to access the API.

Glide(https://github.com/bumptech/glide) to load and cache images.

DaggerHilt(https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependecy injections.
